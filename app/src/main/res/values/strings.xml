    <string name="content_description">Deep frying is a cooking method that involves submerging food in hot oil or fat, cooking it quickly at high temperatures. The food is typically coated in batter or bread crumbs before frying, creating a crispy exterior while locking in moisture and flavor. Deep frying is commonly used for cooking a variety of foods such as French fries, chicken, fish, and vegetables.
